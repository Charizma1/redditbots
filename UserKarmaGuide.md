How to Give Karma on /r/yoursubreddit
========================

Giving karma to someone on /r/yoursubreddit is very easy! If you've had a conversation with someone simply reply:

`+karma`

The bot will pick this up and respond with a message in the thread telling you that karma was awarded or that something went wrong.

**Do Not Edit Your Post to Say "+karma"! This Will Not Work!!**

We don't check the same comment twice. If there is an error, you can repost "+karma" once it's fixed. Editing a post does nothing.

The good rule of thumb is to have a conversation with them before giving karma. A "conversation" requires some back and forth, so you must respond to them at least once before you can give them karma. We require a little back and forth to add a small gate to keep faulty karma reports out, and we assume in the typical trade, a few comments back and forth will happen. This may be subject to change based on how things progress.

Don't forget to give the bot karma! He works hard for everyone! ;)

Reasons Why You Cannot Give Karma
------------------------------------------

So you're trying to give someone karma, but the karma bot is telling you that you messed up. Here's some reasons why that might be happening.

1. The dealer's account isn't in good standing.
 * If someone has a warning, their user flair will be red. 
 * Dealers with red karma cannot be given more karma until they fix whatever conflict caused the warning.
2. There isn't enough evidence of a trade.
 * You cannot just give karma willy-nilly, we have to detect some conversation going on first.
 * The person you're giving karma to must have replied to something you said
 * You must also have replied to something this person said.
 * This ensures there was some form of back-and-forth between you two on /r/yoursubreddit.
3. Similar to #2, you cannot give karma to someone from a top-level comment. 
4. You replied too high up the chain to verify conversation.
 * We go up the chain of comments to figure out the conversation, not down.
 * Try responding to the last message the person sent you in the thread. 
5. You cannot give karma to yourself. Sorry.
6. You cannot give karma to the same person in the same trade post twice.

Reporting Negative Karma
-----------------------------

We no longer have negative karma, but we do have a two-strike warning policy. If you feel as though someone wronged you and you would like to report them, please  [Message the Moderators of /r/yoursubreddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fyoursubreddit) and we'll be happy to assist you. If we find sufficient reason to give this person a warning, we will stop them from receiving any more karma, turn their user flair red showing everyone they have an unresolved trading issue, and we will help mediate a solution between both of you.
